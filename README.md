# Participants wanted for study on Facebook distraction

![](images/fb-distraction.png)

Are you often distracted by Facebook while you work?

We are doing a study to learn which parts of Facebook distract users and what might be done about it. We are looking for student participants at Oxford University (non-freshers), aged 18-30. 

You would come with your laptop to a room at your college twice, for about 20 minutes, fill in questionnaires about yourself and how you use Facebook, and install a browser extension that measures the time you spend.

If you are interested, please contact Ulrik Lyngs (Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford) on ulrik.lyngs@cs.ox.ac.uk. There is no obligation to take part.

**You will be compensated for your time.** You will also receive data and visualisations of your own Facebook use which you may find useful and thought-provoking.
